# Chess

As you might already read in the repository description, this is a java based chess application. It will be modulary and easy to extend. It will contain later an easy user interface, probably coded in JavaFx or Java Swing. Your enemy will be build on easy algorithms.

**Note**: This project is still in wok in progress.

*Project made by Qetz to learn and as a farewell present for my mentor. (Hopefully he don't read it too early.)*
